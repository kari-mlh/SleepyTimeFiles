# SleepyTimeFiles

## Part 1

In part 1, we will be training our own dataset to determine your bedtime based on your desired hours of sleep, wake up time, and predicted stress levels. For this purpose, we will be using the SleepyTimeStress dataset, which can be found directly in this repository. In order to download this file, you can download the entire repository by clicking on the `code` button in the top left, then selecting `Download Zip`. The .README file can then be deleted (unless you'd like to keep a local copy of these instructions!). This data set was adapted from the BetterRest training dataset from Hacking with SwiftUI â€“ thank you for making fun and engaging tutorials that make learning SwiftUI a joy.

## Part 2

In part 2, we will be training an online sentiment analysis dataset which utilizes natural language processing to determine whether a statement is positive, netural, or negative. With this dataset, we will be able to classify our sleep journal entries, and hence our quality of sleep, without having to outright rank our sleep quality (like in traditional sleep journals). For this purpose, we will be using the training dataset used to create Sentiment140. You can read more about Sentiment140 at the following link: http://help.sentiment140.com/home. The download link is available here: http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students. Thank you to the team behind Sentiment140 for making this training data accessible, so projects like this can be developed!
